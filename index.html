          <h3>The Historic Terms of Treaty One</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The treaties provided large areas of land, that had been occupied by
            First Nations, to the Crown which transferred their Indigenous title
            to the Crown, in exchange for reserve lands and other benefits. Each
            band was going to receive a reserve large enough to provide 160
            acres of land for each family of five Each person was to be given a
            one-time payment of three dollars, and a yearly amount of money
            totaling $15 per family of five. The government also agreed to
            maintain a school on each reserve.

          <h3>What Makes Treaty One Different From Other Treaties</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Treaty One was the first treaty signed in Canada, and was the start
            of the creating of the rest of the treaties in Canada. While each
            treaty is based on the same model, all of the treaties are different
            and have different terms and agreements. Because treaty one was the
            first one signed it has less clauses than in future treaties. The
            treaty annuity was $3 while all of the numbered treaties would have
            $5. This amount of money was argued later on and the ammount of
            annuity was raised to $5 to match the other treaties.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>How We Are Implementing Treaty One Today</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            relationships between the Indigenous peoples and the Canadian
            government were started through the numbered treaties. The treaties
            today are providing a framework for living together and sharing the
            land. The treaties provide a foundation for ongoing partnerships.
            New treaties have been signed as of 1975 that benefit everyone, and
            that everyone has agreed on. However reserves do still exist today,
            which is controlled by the Crown. The federal government has control
            over all reserves and can enforce their laws and legal authority
            over the treaties.
