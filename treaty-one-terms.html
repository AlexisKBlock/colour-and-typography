          <h3>The Historic Terms of Treaty One</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Treaty No. 1 was negotiated and entered into in August 1871 at Lower
            Fort Garry. It was signed by government agents Lieutenant-Governor
            Adams G. Archibald, Commissioner Simpson, Major Irvine, and eight
            witnesses. It was also signed for the Anishinaabe and the Swampy
            Cree by Red Eagle or Henry Prince, Bird Forever or William
            Pennefather, Flying Down Bird, Centre of Birds Tail, Flying Round,
            Whip-poor-will, and Yellow Quill. The Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree
            were to cede, release, surrender, and yield to her Majesty the
            Queen.The land described in the treaty was a substantial amount of
            present day southeast and south central Manitoba, including the Red
            River Valley, north to the lower parts of Lake Manitoba and Lake
            Winnipeg and west along the Assiniboine River to the towns of
            Portage la Prairie and Brandon. The treaties provided large areas of
            land, that had been occupied by First Nations, to the Crown which
            transferred their Indigenous title to the Crown, in exchange for
            reserve lands and other benefits. Each band was going to receive a
            reserve large enough to provide 160 acres of land for each family of
            five Each person was to be given a one-time payment of three
            dollars, and a yearly amount of money totaling fifteen dollars per
            family of five. The government also agreed to maintain a school on
            each reserve and to prohibit the introduction or sale of liquor on
            reserves.
