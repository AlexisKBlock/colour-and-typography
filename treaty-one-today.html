          <p>
            Treaty One was the first treaty signed in Canada, and was the start
            of the creating of the rest of the treaties in Canada. It was
            created to help establish Western Canada. All of the numbered
            treaties following this one were based on the promises and
            agreements that were established by Treaty One. While each treaty is
            based on the same model, all of the treaties are different and have
            different terms and agreements. Because treaty one was the first one
            signed it has less clauses than in future treaties. The treaty
            annuity was $3 while all of the numbered treaties would have $5.
            This amount of money was argued later on and the ammount of annuity
            was raised to $5 to match the other treaties. Not all promises of
            Treaty One have been met and are still being reviewed today. Unlike
            some of the other Treaties, Treaty one has had no land additions.

          <h3>How We Are Implementing Treaty One Today</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Relationships between the Indigenous peoples and the Canadian
            government were started through the numbered treaties. The treaties
            today are providing a framework for living together and sharing the
            land. The treaties provide a foundation for ongoing partnerships.
            Modern treaties have been signed as of 1975 that benefit everyone,
            and that everyone has agreed on. They establish defined land
            ownership and jurisdiction and a new relationship based on respect,
            trust, and understanding. However reserves do still exist today,
            which are controlled by the Crown. The federal government has
            control over all reserves and can enforce their laws and legal
            authority over the treaties. Treaty One is still recognized by the
            crown today. Not all of the promises made in the treaty have been
            met and are still being met in Canada today. The First Nations
            people are starting to receive more of the land that was promised to
            them.
